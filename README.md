# **  WeatherPy

## *Project Overview*
Plan My tip is a top travel company that specializes in internet services for Hotels and Lodging services. Need to help Jack collect and present Data for customers via the search page which they will filter based on their preferred travel criteria to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. to perform this analysis and create our Itenery plan and maps we will use, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, CitiPy, Python Requests, APIs, JSON.

 
                  
## *Analysis & Results*
### Analysis
To perform this task I will Use Jupyter Notebook and CitiPy Module to collect weather data from over 500 Cities over the world. Then I will perform requests on the Openweather Map API to retrieve the JSON weather data from these cities. this data will help the team to  Then The weather Data will be added to Pandas DataFrame using MatplotLib to create series of
scatter plots to show the relationship between Lattitied and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world. as part of the analysis need to perform statistical calculations on the data using linear regression on the weather parameters in northern and southern Hampshire. This data will help the team predict the best time of the year for people to plan their vacations. Finally, we need to export the data clean it and use the weather data to use the best vacation based on certain weather criteria, and then map these cities on a map using Jupyetr gmap and google places API.  
         
    
## Results & Summary
The out will give 3 Maps

### Advantages
 By writing code with  Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, CitiPy, Python Requests, APIs, JSON. is a powerful tool enabling the work with a large scale of Data and Plotting these Data into charts and Maps. using the API tool is helpful to retrieve information and plot Info. om Maps (using gmap and Google Places API)
